# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 22, 2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Read docs on React Native design. Focused on align, flex and justify properties, and read through the given examples. I started designing the UI and planning for a listing app project.

**Thoughts:** I need to just get my head around the different components available with React Native. The most obvious seem to be ScrollView, View, List and Button. Alignment of elements onto view will be the most difficult part. I should be able to finish a draft of the UI by tomorrow or Sunday.

Resources I used today.

- [Button](https://reactnative.dev/docs/button)

### Day 1: May 23, 2020 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed header issue on iPhone X and XS. Corrected spacing between buttons on top.

**Thoughts:** I did not get much done today as I had a much needed family day today. It's been a long time since we have been able to go out due to quarantine. I will focus on creating a list of text input tomorrow and creating a space for image upload.
