# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 22, 2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Read docs on React Native design. Focused on align, flex and justify properties, and read through the given examples. I started designing the UI and planning for a listing app project.

**Thoughts:** I need to just get my head around the different components available with React Native. The most obvious seem to be ScrollView, View, List and Button. Alignment of elements onto view will be the most difficult part. I should be able to finish a draft of the UI by tomorrow or Sunday.
