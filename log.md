# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 22, 2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Read docs on React Native design. Focused on align, flex and justify properties, and read through the given examples. I started designing the UI and planning for a listing app project.

**Thoughts:** I need to just get my head around the different components available with React Native. The most obvious seem to be ScrollView, View, List and Button. Alignment of elements onto view will be the most difficult part. I should be able to finish a draft of the UI by tomorrow or Sunday.

Resources I used today.

- [UI Layout](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox)
- [Core components](https://reactnative.dev/docs/intro-react-native-components#native-components)
- [Button](https://reactnative.dev/docs/button)

### Day 1: May 23, 2020 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed header issue on iPhone X and XS. Corrected spacing between buttons on top.

**Thoughts:** I did not get much done today as I had a much needed family day today. It's been a long time since we have been able to go out due to quarantine. I will focus on creating a list of text input tomorrow and creating a space for image upload.

### Day 2: May 24, 2020 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Built React App with a React Native CLI instead of Expo due to limitations in viewing Android and iOS emulators. Evaluating the requirements of the app influenced this decision. I read the docs on Platform compatibility and screen navigation.

**Thoughts**: Much like yesterday, I did not get too much time to work on actual coding today but I have a whole day ahead tomorrow. Will work on building individual components for the screen and navigation. If I encounter any struggles with js, I will make a note of it and write it in my blog.

Adding one make up day for lack of coding **+1**

Resources I used today.

- [Nav](https://reactnative.dev/docs/navigation)
- [Example of Platform selection](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Libraries/NewAppScreen/components/DebugInstructions.js)
- [Platform guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/platform-specific-code)

### Day 3: May 25, 2020 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Installed React Navigation into project. Took about 2-3hrs to get it working on iOS due to dependency issues. Still need to fix it for Android. Worked through 70ish challenges on basic Javascript to get up to speed on it.

**Thoughts**: It was really encouraging to get through the installations so I can actually start the UI. I do not want to delay this process any longer so will aim to get the first screen designed tomorrow.

### Reflection 10/06/2020

There was a gap in progress. Balancing programming for a uni project I work on and the start of a new uni semester. I have developed a new plan and focus for the next few weeks. Hopefully this will help me be consistent with logging my progress.

**üë©‚Äçüé§ü•ÅLyric Analysisüé∫üéπ**

- End of week ...refactor/debug my code. Ensure navigation between pages works.
- End of month ...enable side by side comparison of from selected group of artists.
- Extension:
    - Do a live web scrape of lyrics on demand for artists not included in database,
or allow user to input their own text.
    - Use API to allow user to listen to a sample of the artist's music with relevant song.

**üë©‚ÄçüíªAlgorithmsüéì**

- To supplement my Algorithms course for uni. I will commit to doing LeetCode exercises
everyday or second day.
- Extension:
     - Write a beginner's tutorial guide on a Jekyll blog
     - Break down famous algorithms and write up mini-biographies on these inventors!
     I love some history, it's good to appreciate those who've come before :)

### Day 14: June 13, 2020 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Mainly focused on cleaning up code for my uni project and modifying my code to fix up some graph visualisation issues. I didn't have much time as I have an assignment due soon. Need to change viewport size of the graph to avoid node overlaps.

**Thoughts**: I need to work more efficiently and log my attempts at certain approaches. Avoid repeating approaches to fix a problem.

### Day 15: June 17, 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**: Took two days break as a I had an important university assignment to attend to. I worked on refactoring my graph visualisation code and made some documentation.

**Thoughts**: I would like learn shell scripting to automate some processes. I also need to build a habit of using virtual environments. And also need to do more object oriented and modular programming to avoid having to refactor many times.
