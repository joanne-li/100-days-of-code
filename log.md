# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 22, 2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**: Read docs on React Native design. Focused on align, flex and justify properties, and read through the given examples. I started designing the UI and planning for a listing app project.

**Thoughts:** I need to just get my head around the different components available with React Native. The most obvious seem to be ScrollView, View, List and Button. Alignment of elements onto view will be the most difficult part. I should be able to finish a draft of the UI by tomorrow or Sunday.

Resources I used today.

- [Core components](https://reactnative.dev/docs/intro-react-native-components#native-components)
- [Button](https://reactnative.dev/docs/button)

### Day 1: May 23, 2020 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed header issue on iPhone X and XS. Corrected spacing between buttons on top.

**Thoughts:** I did not get much done today as I had a much needed family day today. It's been a long time since we have been able to go out due to quarantine. I will focus on creating a list of text input tomorrow and creating a space for image upload.

### Day 2: May 24, 2020 (Sunday)

**Today's Progress**: Built React App with a React Native CLI instead of Expo due to limitations in viewing Android and iOS emulators. Evaluating the requirements of the app influenced this decision. I read the docs on Platform compatibility and screen navigation.

**Thoughts**: Much like yesterday, I did not get too much time to work on actual coding today but I have a whole day ahead tomorrow. Will work on building individual components for the screen and navigation. If I encounter any struggles with js, I will make a note of it and write it in my blog.

Adding one make up day for lack of coding **+1**

### Day 3: May 25, 2020 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**: Installed React Navigation into project. Took about 2-3hrs to get it working on iOS due to dependency issues. Still need to fix it for Android. Worked through 70ish challenges on basic Javascript to get up to speed on it.

**Thought**: It was really encouraging to get through the installations so I can actually start the UI. I do not want to delay this process any longer so will aim to get the first screen designed tomorrow.
