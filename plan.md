# Game Plan

Primarily focus on building skills on ReactJS and React Native for project work. Secondary focus is getting into the habit of improving algorithm skills.

Would be ideal to alternate between these two subgoals, if feeling unmotivated/stuck for one of them.

**ReactJS Skill Building**

- Continue building web app on [Lyric Cruncher](https://github.com/joanne-li/lyric-cruncher).
- Practice ReactJS fundamentals on [code sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/index2) when not doing project work.

**React Native Skill Building**

- Work on item listing app for volunteer project.
- Build productivity app to track hours spent on tasks

**Algorithm skills**

- Practice Leet code problems (primarily medium level difficulty)
- Read Cracking the Coding Interview and steer through example problems.
